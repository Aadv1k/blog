Being home alone is quite an eerie experience, I do enjoy the solitude and peace it provides me with, the comfort of being able to blast music or sing or do whatever since it is only you in the house. However it comes with a certain terror, a certain feeling that always bugs me at the back of my mind _"Am I really alone?"_

But it's just that, a feeling, yet another thought our imaginative brain is
capable of conjuring - But I write this not to yonder about the human brain and
it's shortcomings, I write this as a warning, to you the reader. I have
compiled a set of rules, from my own experiences, remember this may happen
anytime you are alone in the premise of a household, and it is not guaranteed
that these rules might help you, but it is the best chance you may have.

### Rules for surviving alone

1. Make sure to lock all doors, this is done not to prevent intruders from entering your house, but as a warning to yourself when you find the doors ajar, so that you can be sure that he has entered your house. If at any moment you find anyof the previously closed doors ajar, refer to rule 5.

2. If at any moment, your housemates are found to be in the balcony, PUSH THEM. If you wish to save that person, push it; It isn't what it seems to be, I don't know what it is, but it seems to be a being that assumes the identity of someone not present in the house, if succeed in entering their room, the original poster will DIE and the doppelganger will assume their identity, so please, for the love of god, PUSH IT.

3. If any knocking comes from within your house - walls, doors, ceiling, ignore it to the best of your ability, it wants your attention, whatever you do, as long as the knocking is going on DO NOT LEAVE WHATEVER ROOM you are in, it doesn't matter if its the kitchen or the bathroom do not leave your room, it is out to get you. If you fail to do so, refer to rule 5.

4. Your house may contain WIFI, if it does, and at any moment while browsing the web you come across a website with your house as it's domain, IMMEDIATELY shut down the WIFI, and resist the urge to click it or turn the WiFi until either the patrons return or 12 hours have passed - If you click it, it is too late for you, you have invited it into your house, your screen will go back and at any moment the bell will ring, from here, you are completely on your own, you might refer to rule 5 for help, but this is uncharted territory.

5. This perhaps is the most important rule among all, if during your solitude, a previously closed door is left ajar, be prepared because it has entered your house, and it will try each and every opportunity to mimick your behaviour and routine, you may first find it near your front door, it will be expressionless and wearing the same outfit as yourself, IGNORE IT, DO NOT interact with it, no matter what, you must do everything in your power to do unusual things you don't usually do, these can include - sitting on the floor instead of your bed, using your left hand to drink instead of right, just little things about your identity that aren't correct, if you let it get out of your sight, it will move towards your room (or if you are already in your room, try and get you out of it) if it enters, and you find it doing what you were previously doing, turn off the light and close the door, count to 10 and open it again, one of two things may happen

   1. It has disappeared, good, it might return again but for now it has gone
   2. It is still there, this is bad news, it is determined at assuming your identity, at this stage, I would suggest you close the door and sit at the furthest point from the room, what happens next is unknown, some say, it might go away on its own, however, if it doesn't and your housemates return, too bad for you, for you are now nothing but a reflection of the doppelganger, you may try the opposite of the rules given above to try and trick it the same way it did to you, but you may be surprised to find that your doppelganger is more YOU than YOU.

Good luck
