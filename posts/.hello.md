So this is my first post here on this (what I hope to be a good) blog, which
serves as a place for me to share my journey, projects, rants about books or
life and pretty much anything and everything in between. 

As of now, this site is made using `hugo` + the `contrast-hugo` theme with some
of my own tweaks, something I will change a lot in the future, and will
probably need to make a proper fork of the repo, oh hey a **TODO** for my
future self.

Anything might change since I am still figuring out hugo, will probably need to
prod and probe with it quite a bit.

Anyways, to whoever is reading this, have a nice day; Bye.
