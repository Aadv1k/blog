We all have an irrational fear of something following us in the dark, I find it quite amusing that
we humans have a natural instinct that tells us to get our guards up as soon as we flick that living
room light off, when I was kid I used to dread doing this, as soon as I would press the switch, I
would get submerdged in the pitch blackness, the only light coming from the open bedroom, acting as
a beacon for my younger self to run towards like a fly does towards a bulb. _Click_ the minute the
flick of the switch entered my ears I would make a break for it, my legs running as fast as they
could at the time, I wished to take a look back out of curosity, or maybe it was my brain making
sure that it was wrong about the gut feeling, but something kept my eyes glued to the illuminated
room, it felt safe, warm and cozy, my legs would feel heavy but I carried on, My mind afraid that a
nocturnal entity was just few meters away from catching me and taking me to hell. A sigh of relief
would wash over me as I would reach my open room, grab the doorknob and yank the door shut, just
taking a single look back into the darkness that lay beyond the door, as the darkness stared back at
me. _Thuk_ the door would shut and I would relax, laying on my bed, and allowing sleep to take over
me.

"A child's imagination does wonders", I said to myself, recalling how I had these kind of
experiences every night, and how nothing really came out of it. As I sipped the last drops of my
tea, I stood up, looked up at the wall clock, "12:05" it said, "It's getting pretty late, I should
probably hit the sack" I said, my room was located on the second floor, the stairs of which were
directly in front of my dining table, I looked up at my room and saw the lights were open _I don't
remember having the lights on_ I moved across my kitchen and as my hands hovered over the light
switch, a chill went up my spine, suppresing it, I flicked the switch, _Click_ it resounded as I was
submerdged in complete darkness, a slight _thuck_ made every hair in my body stand,an adreline
surge rushed through me and as if I was transported back to my childhood, I made a break for it,
running towards my open room, like a madman, the room looked cozy, comfortable and safe, as I
started climbing the stairs, the tea cup that I had forgot to put in sink, fell, resulting in a
loud _Crash_, my heart was throbbing, it was true fear. Pure fear carried me faster than I had in
many years, relief washed over me as I reached my room, I grabbed the doorknob and yanked the room
shut, I sighed, my muscles relaxed and all was good, until I stared into the corner of my room, a
pair of red eyes stared back at me, with a wide unnatural grin, tears swelled up in my eyes and I
dropped to my knees _It had won_ _It had adapted_
